Instructor
Problem: Students have long, wordy sentences
Solution: Tool to keep track of this, and perfect their writing.
Students: 45 per unit, and up to 6 sections per semester
Computers: Doesnt know what kind they are using.
Computer Skills: From no tech experience to being pretty proficcient.
Familiarity with pcs: Some who program, some with no.
Submission: Raw text file through emails.

Command Line Java based tool.
Students can run, and will be provided documents on how to use.
Error conditions, develop reasonable friendly messages to go with.

Word: Care about longer words, > 3 letters. Make it flexible.
Sentence: Anything that ends in a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark. Or even with a comma or a colon. She only cares about sentences that are not gramatically correct or too long.

i.e. will make configurable what is considered an end of sentence, as she seems on fence on if comma is end of a sentence.

The actual end result to students is the average number of words per sentence.

Customization of word length.

Some kind of variablity on what we want to have as acceptable sentence structure. i.e. periods..etc

End result to students is if we are successful:
They will get the average number of words per sentence,
otherwise we tell them something a little helpful to put them on the right track to use the toll correctly (not error codes, something nicer)
