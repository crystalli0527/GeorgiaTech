# **Project Plan -- Team 52**



##1 Introduction



Lauren has noticed her students' essays contains sentences constructed of too many words, which reflects poor writing style. The Word Count (WC) software tool is a command line program providing the average word count, per sentence, within a submitted essay. Lauren's students will use WC and compare its output to Lauren's recommended average for proper sentence length. The project goal is WC will improve students' writing style by allowing them to objectively determine if sentence word count is excessive.
