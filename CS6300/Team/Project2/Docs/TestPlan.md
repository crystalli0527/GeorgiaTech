## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

Each member of Team 52 whom contributes to TCCart's source code will also implement the appropriate unit and integration tests. Matt Hernandez, as QA Manager, will generate the system tests. Nathan Marcos and Robert Skelton will validate required functionality by conducting the test cases contained within this document. Alexander Trusov will remediate any discovered bugs.

### 1.2 Test Selection

Test case selection was primarily focused on the system and acceptance test levels. The test cases were built around the functional requirements and specifications. Given the test cases are centered on system behavior, testing can be considered black-box.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

**Structural Coverage**
Structural coverage will be assessed at the unit and integration test level. Coverage analysis will be based on statement, decision, and condition coverage. Testing quality is relative to if the coverage metrics meet the pre-determined coverage percentage. 

**Functional Coverage**
Functional coverage will be assessed at the system test level. Use cases were developed according to the requirements and expected conditions. Specifically, quality is measured based upon TCCart exhibiting all expected output and behavior.  

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Bugs and enhancements will be tracked through a shared document on the Github repository, accessible by all Team 52 members. 

### 1.5 Technology

Code development will be conducted via Android Studio, utilizing the Java language. Github will provide version control. Unit and integration tests will utilize JUnit.
