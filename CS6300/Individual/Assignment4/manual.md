This manual will provide instructions on how to use "Converter" by Robert Skelton

Converter is a simple Android app to convert from one unit to another.

Supported units are miles, feet, inches, kilometers, meters, and centimeters. 

Simply select what unit is your input, select what unit is your output,

Type a numeral that you want converted into the "Input" field.

Click "Convert" and the app will do the math for you!

The result is shown in the "Result" section. 

To reset to the defaults and clear the text fields, click reset. 

Every unit can convert to every other unit.

Precision is set to 12 decimal places, because precision is good!

To get the app, clone this respository, and open the Assignment4/Converter folder in Android Studio. Click the green run/play arrow at the top, and hook up your phone. If you want, you can even export to an apk via Android Studio.
