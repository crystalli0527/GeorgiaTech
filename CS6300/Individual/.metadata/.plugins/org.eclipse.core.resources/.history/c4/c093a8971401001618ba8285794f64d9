/*Story Card #1: 
“The instructor (or the TA) launches the GradesCalculator tool to get information about the students and the class. 
The application outputs on screen the number of students and information about each student: name, GTID, email, attendance, and team number. 
It also prints the number of assignments and projects given so far. 
After that, it asks the users if they want to continue or exit. In the former case, it outputs the information again.”
